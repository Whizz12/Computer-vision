# DCGAN Image Generation Project

A TensorFlow implementation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) for generating high-quality images. This project demonstrates stable training of GANs using convolutional networks with batch normalization.

## Overview
This repository contains:
- DCGAN implementation with TensorFlow 2.x
- Preprocessing pipeline for image datasets
- Trained generator model (HDF5 format)
- Jupyter notebook with training visualization

Key features:
- 128x128 image resolution support
- Customizable latent space dimension
- Progressive growing of generated images


**Requirements**:
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.10+
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Pillow
